Each file (*.asc) is an EEG file in plain text format, with 4 seconds worth of data.
nch=61 (number of electrodes)
tf=512 (number of time frames)
sf=256 (sampling rate in Hz)

List with electrode names in correct order: List61e.txt

Recordings were performed under two different eyes-closed conditions of three runs each:
Object visualization (visualizing a detailed image of an object, e.g. a deer)
Verbalization (internally formulating a verbal definition of an abstract noun, e.g. "Familiarization")


Possible analyses:
1. Compare EEG microstate parameters (coverage, duration, occurrance) during object visualization vs. verbalization
2. Compare EEG microstate topographies obtaind from object visualization vs. verbalization


Subdirectory and data structure:

1 folder, 29 datafiles (4 s each)

File name convention:

Filename example: vp01_O2.asc

vp01*: participant number
*_O*: condition (here object visualization)
*2*: run (here O2, second run of object visualization)


--- Note

Originally, 50 s of EEG were recorded during 6/7 runs in 70 participants (see Milz et al. 2016). This dataset was created from a small extract of the pilot dataset.
